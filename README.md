## Login And Signup :

You can login and sign up in the application and the user will be registered on signup in the database. All of these functionalities are working for now, using a data.json, which will later be changed to the mongoDB.

## Pagination and Filters :

Using the api calls, the pagination divides the data into a number of pages. And the filters are managed through the same api call.
This allows the app to be more dynamic and flexible by allowing to manage both the pagination and filtering.
